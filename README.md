# Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains examples of all major design patterns implemented in Java.

The patterns are organized into six major categories:

## Table of Contents
- [Creational Patterns](#creational-patterns)
- [Structural Patterns](#structural-patterns)
- [Behavioral Patterns](#behavioral-patterns)
- [Concurrency Patterns](#concurrency-patterns)
- [Architectural Patterns](#architectural-patterns)
- [Enterprise Patterns](#enterprise-patterns)
- [Additional Patterns](#additional-patterns)
- [References](#references)

---

- Prototype

---

## Structural Patterns
_Focus: How classes and objects are composed to form larger structures._

- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

---

## Behavioral Patterns
_Focus: Communication between objects, responsibility assignment._

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

---

## Concurrency Patterns
_Focus: Multi-threaded programming, safe concurrent operations._

- Thread Pool
- Producer-Consumer
- Read-Write Lock
- Future
- Balking
- Double-Checked Locking
- Guarded Suspension

---

## Architectural Patterns
_Focus: High-level application structuring for scalability and maintainability._

- Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- Model-View-Presenter (MVP)
- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)

---

## Enterprise Patterns
_Focus: Large-scale application best practices for maintainability and scalability._

- Data Access Object (DAO)
- Repository Pattern
- Service Layer Pattern
- Data Transfer Object (DTO)
- Value Object
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- Factory (Business Factory)

---

## Additional Patterns
_Focus: Real-world patterns frequently used in modern applications._

- Dependency Injection
- Null Object Pattern
- Object Pool Pattern

---

## How to Use
Each design pattern includes:
- A simple, self-contained Java example
